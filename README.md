# Azimuth-and-Bearing
Azimuth and Bearing for iOS and Swift

Allow you to point the compass to a coordinate instead of north. Calculate Bearing and Azimuth.

Simply copy (or reference) the file LocationAzimuthBearing.swif in to your project.

It has all the function you need to evven turn the compass to the right direction.

Soon I will add a demo project.
